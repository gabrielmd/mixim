Description of the tests:

Interval between two transmissions on each node: 1s
Sink node: 0
Route discovery: every 1200s started by the sink node

1) 80 nodes transmitting data to the sink.
	- 5000 packets each one


2) 9 nodes transmitting data to the sink.
	- 5000 packets each one
	- the whole space (9x9) was subdivided into 3x3 squares
	- only the nodes positioned in the middle of the squares transmitted data
	- node numbers: 10, 13, 16, 37, 40, 43, 64, 67, 70
	- all the others are turned off

3) 80 nodes transmitting data to the sink
	- the whole space (9x9) was subdivided into 3x3 squares
	- only the nodes positioned in the middle of the squares transmitted 5000 packets
	- other nodes transmitted 2500
